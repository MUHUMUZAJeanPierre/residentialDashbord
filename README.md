# University Residence Management System Dashboard

## Project Overview

Welcome to the final summative project of the Advanced Front-End module. This group project challenges you to showcase your advanced front-end development skills by building a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard for a university residence management system.

## Project Description

Develop a responsive and interactive dashboard for university residence staff using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a chosen framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind). The dashboard should provide the following functionalities:

### Functionalities

1. **Data Visualization**
   - Utilize charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to represent residence data such as occupancy rates, room types, and maintenance requests.

2. **Room Management**
   - Display a list of rooms with details including resident information, room status (occupied, vacant, under maintenance), and basic amenities.
   - Include functionalities for filtering and sorting rooms.

3. **Maintenance Requests**
   - Provide a section to view and manage maintenance requests submitted by residents.
   - Include functionalities to filter by room, status (pending, ongoing, completed), and add notes.

4. **Alerts and Notifications**
   - Display important alerts and notifications for staff, such as upcoming room inspections, maintenance deadlines, or urgent resident requests.

5. **Theme Switcher**
   - Implement a feature that allows staff to switch between different themes (light/dark or custom colors) using browser storage (cookies or local storage).

## Technical Considerations

- **HTML**
  - Use Semantic HTML for improved accessibility and SEO.
